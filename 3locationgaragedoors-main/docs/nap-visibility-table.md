## Visibility & Verification Notes

* All three hubs will display street addresses once Lexington and Northern Kentucky provide verified locations. Louisville remains unchanged.
* GBP profile URLs for every hub plus Lexington and Northern Kentucky phone/address inputs are still outstanding. They are intentionally flagged as **TBD** placeholders so stakeholders can supply confirmed data before anything reaches production templates.
* With stakeholder sign-off on the placeholders above, this table can now be committed. Update the repository templates with the verified Lexington and Northern Kentucky details and GBP links as soon as they are available.
